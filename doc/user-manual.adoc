== Introduction
AlchemyLanguage is a collection of text analysis functions that derive semantic information from your content.
You can input text, HTML, or a public URL and leverage sophisticated natural language processing techniques to
get a quick high-level understanding of your content and obtain detailed insights such as directional sentiment from entity to object.
With this connector you have full access to AlchemyLanguage methods.


Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector.
Check features, compatibility and versions of the connector using the https://github.com/Admios/watson-alchemy-language-connector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[Release Notes].
