== Introduction
AlchemyLanguage is a collection of text analysis functions that derive semantic information from your content.
You can input text, HTML, or a public URL and leverage sophisticated natural language processing techniques to
get a quick high-level understanding of your content and obtain detailed insights such as directional sentiment from entity to object.
With this connector you have full access to AlchemyLanguage methods.
