//Global rule: the word "connector" should be lower case except when appearing in titles, important URL anchors, and after a MuleSoft tradename such as "Anypoint".
== Introduction
AlchemyLanguage is a collection of text analysis functions that derive semantic information from your content.
You can input text, HTML, or a public URL and leverage sophisticated natural language processing techniques to
get a quick high-level understanding of your content and obtain detailed insights such as directional sentiment from entity to object.
With this connector you have full access to AlchemyLanguage methods.


Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector.
Check features, compatibility and versions of the connector using the https://github.com/Admios/watson-alchemy-language-connector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[Release Notes].
Connector API link:apidocs/watson-alchemy-language-apidoc.adoc[API Reference] or check our link:/demo_app[demo applications].

* Anypoint Studio 6.0.x
* Oracle Java JDK 7.0

=== Extensions for Anypoint Studio
* Anypoint DevKit 1.1.4+
* Mule Server Runtime 3.8.0 EE

* Already have an account in IMB Bluemix, you may create it https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/[here].
* Have an Watson API Key for Alchemy Language https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/watson[Watson page].


== Install the Connector

Now to test our connector we need to create a HTTP flow.

In the Mule Palette, select connectors and drag and drop HTTP Connector in to the flow designer.

image::user-guide-02.png[Select HTTP connector]
First we need to config the HTTP request service before using it. Click on the http connector and later in the HTTP tab below.

image::user-guide-03.png[Select Http tab]
when the configuration view appear, click on the green plus icon in the right of the field "Connector Configuration."
Just set the port to 8080 or any number of your preference. Save by click OK.


image::user-guide-04.png[save port 8080]
Back in the Http configuration tab; select Basic Settings -> Path. Write _/watson_
This is for url path of the endpoint to be listen for Anypoint.
Should look like this.

=== Configure the Connector Global Element

From the Mule Palette - Connectors drag and drop IBM Watson Text Processors.

To use the IBM Watson connector in your Mule application, you must configure the basic connector configuration.
Select the IBM Watson Text Processor tab

image::user-guide-06.png[Add watson connector]
. Click in the green plus sign
. Add your API Key from IBM Bluemix/Watson
. Test Connection

image::user-guide-07.png[Add API Key]
You should receive a successful message after connection test. Click Ok to save the Watson Configuration.

To Test the Connector we will use the method Language Detection.

. Select Language Detection from the operations drop-down list.
. Add some text in the source field. e.g. Mi√©rcoles 3 de agosto de 2016
. Add an _Object to JSON_ Transformer after the Watson Connector.
. Start the server doing right click and then click in the green play button

image::user-guide-08.png[Start the server]
When the console finish it will show some message like *Application testwatson default deployed*

Now is time to go to a web browser and enter the url we previously configure: _http://localhost:8080/watson_

image::user-guide-09.png[Check connector output]
Congratulations you have completed the Quick Start Guide.
